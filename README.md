## Malaria-parasite-MRI-Scan-Classification" 
### Description
Malaria-Parasite-Detection is an advanced image classification project aimed at identifying malaria parasites in microscopic images of blood samples. This project utilizes three deep learning models—CNN, VGG16, and ResNet50—to accurately detect the presence of malaria parasites, thereby aiding in early diagnosis and treatment. The models are designed to offer high accuracy and robustness, with the CNN model achieving the highest accuracy of 96%. This project is crucial for improving healthcare outcomes in regions affected by malaria.
